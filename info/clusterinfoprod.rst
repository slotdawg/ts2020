Networks
........

At the beginning of each lab track, you will be instructed to create a user specific VLAN, detailed in the :ref:`clusterassignments` spreadsheet. This network will be used for the majority of exercises. The following, additional virtual networks have been pre-configured for each cluster:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 33 33
   :header-rows: 1

   * -
     - **Primary** Network
     - **Secondary** Network

   <strong><font color="red">Unless instructed otherwise in a lab, please use your user specific VLAN for VM deployments. If instructed to use the Primary or Secondary networks for an exercise, be sure to clean up unneeded VMs afterwards (or remove their NICs) to ensure IP space availability. With ~6 users sharing each cluster, IP space and memory are the two most contended resources.</font></strong>
